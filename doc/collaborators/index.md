# Ways of working for collaborators, friends, partners, etc.

View the issue as “we” not “me”.

Consider what's happening from each person's perspective.

Create more understanding, and less conflict.

Focus on one topic, rather than multiple topics.

Focus on one goal, rather than just airing your needs.

Brainstorm solutions.

Acknowledge that growth together is a process, and allow time for changes to happen.

Ask for a time out, if you want one.

Accept where you are. It’s OK if things aren’t perfect.

Look for your part in the issue. Each person has a part, a role in happiness or unhappiness.

Make it safe to share. This includes giving a heads up about a big conversation, choosing a neutral time and place, and so on.

If the issue can’t be solved right away, then agree to check in from time to time to discuss the issue.

If talking feels difficult, then consider using writing. For example, you can write an email or journal entry to ask questions, suggest improvements, or describe emotions.

If communication feels blocked, then consider using a third party. For example, consider asking for help from a coach, counselor, meditator, therapist, or trusted friend.
