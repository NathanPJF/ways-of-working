# Ways of working for safety and reliability

Each teammate knows what to do if another teamate is absent, including who handles what, how, when, and why.

When there's an issue, then we have a way to triage it, handle it, learn from it, and improve because of it.

When we have dangerous setups, we use lockout/tagout.

Each of our significant projects has a risk log, and its kept up to date.

We use backups that match our planned level of risk, and we regularly verify that the backups work.
