# Ways of working for communications

Communications are radiated when events happen, so teammates can be in the loop.

Communications provide equitable participation for everyone involved.

Communications have preferred channels, such as chat, or email, or video, or forum.

We want communications to be linkable, searchable, commentable, and correctable.

Our communications are [mutual interactions](../mutual/index.md), and use mutual respect and mutual purpose.

Our communications aim to help "[maker's schedule, manager's schedule](../makers-schedule-managers-schedule-by-paul-graham.md)".

For communications in meetings, we use our [ways of working for meetings](../signing/index.md).

For communications in our groups and on our video calls, we use our [ways of working for signing](../signing/index.md).

Teammates commit to read communications sent directly to them within 1 business day.

Our social networking pages that are relevant to the team, such as our company LinkedIn page, are up to date.
