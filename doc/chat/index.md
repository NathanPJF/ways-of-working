# Ways of working for chat and messaging

Minimize first messages that are vague, such as "Hi" or "Have a minute?". Instead, state your idea, question, etc.

Favor shortcuts such as symbols, hashtags, emojis, etc. Example: "+1" means "I agree", "#todo" means "For our TODO list", and a green-checkmark emoji means "Done".

Write expectations: if you expect chat and messaging to be interrupt-driven, or 24x7 urgent, or response-required, then explicity write it.

If you want information to be available to the teammates, then emphasize all-team channels versus one-to-one channels.

Ensure people get responses. If people feel that channel messages are not getting adequate repsponses, then people tend to go back to DMs and other high-escalation communications.
